# IntenseLogic Archive

IntenseLogic is a game engine that I worked on several years ago.
Development started on May 23, 2012 and continued up until the last
functional change on December 24, 2015.

It's written in C, and originally had a Lua scripting API, although this
was eventually abandoned.

The original goal was to be a competitor to Roblox with more powerful
Lua scripting. This was in 2012, when Roblox was more of a Lego building
game with user-made levels, than the game platform that it is today.
