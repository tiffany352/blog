<h1>About</h1>

<p>
  I'm a software engineer living in the SF Bay Area. I like working on UI
  systems and related tools, I find tooling really interesting. I find UI
  interesting in pretty much every area - Unicode, text rendering, layout, app
  design, both on the web and elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
  Most of the projects and contributions on my GitHub are stuff I found
  interesting to work on in my free time.
</p>

<p>
  The most popular hobby project I’ve made to date is
  <a href="https://rinkcalc.app">Rink</a>
  - a dimensionality analysis tool and unit-based calculator that’s useful for
  answering tons of different questions.
