<p>
  I’m a 23 year old software engineer currently living in the SF Bay Area. I
  currently work at Roblox, headquartered in San Mateo.

<p>
  I’ve spent a lot of my career so far working on game engines and related
  areas. One of my main interests is in developing powerful UI systems that back
  highly dynamic apps and game UI.

  Before Roblox, I spent 6 years working on hobby game engines and on open
  source software. My

  The most popular hobby project I’ve made to date is
  <a href="https://rinkcalc.app">Rink</a>
  - a dimensionality analysis tool and unit-based calculator that’s useful for
  answering tons of different questions.
